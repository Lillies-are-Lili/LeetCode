# LeetCode


Synopsis

Quite simple, this is a simple repository that provides all of the LeetCode questions Iâ€™ve mastered. I've created branches for each language I've completed the question in, and then further branches that separete the questions based on what type of question it is. 

Motivation

This repository is meant to highlight my programming skills to companies and recruiters, as well as demonstrate my knowledge of Git and Github, alike.

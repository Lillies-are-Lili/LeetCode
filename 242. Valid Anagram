242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Solution:
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
       
    char[] sChar = s.toCharArray();
    char[] tChar = t.toCharArray();

    Arrays.sort(sChar);
    Arrays.sort(tChar);

    return Arrays.equals(sChar, tChar);
    }
}

/**
This one was very simple to think about. Just add the two strings to char arrays, sort them, and if the arrays are equal, then its true.
